# **Serverless Contact Form Using Google Cloud Functions & Cloud Storage**

This project demonstrates a fully serverless contact form built using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. It showcases how simple front-end inputs can be processed and stored securely using cloud-native services—without managing any servers.

## **📌 Project Overview**

The application consists of a lightweight **HTML5 contact form** where users can submit their **name** and **message**. Upon submission, the form sends data to a deployed **Google Cloud Function**, which automatically validates the input and stores it inside **Cloud Storage** or **Firestore**. The entire workflow is secure, scalable, and event-driven.

This project is ideal for beginners exploring **serverless architectures**, **GCP automation**, and **real-time data handling**.

## **🚀 Features**

* Simple and responsive **HTML contact form**
* Backend logic handled entirely by **Cloud Functions**
* Secure data storage using **Cloud Storage** or **Firestore**
* IAM-based access control for safe operations
* Viewable logs inside **Cloud Logging** for debugging and monitoring
* Completely serverless — no VM management required
* Easy to deploy, extend, and integrate with other GCP services

---

## **🧰 Google Cloud Services Used**

* **Cloud Functions** – Handles form submission event and processes data
* **Cloud Storage / Firestore** – Stores submitted form entries
* **IAM** – Manages permissions and secure resource access
* **Cloud Logging** – Captures logs for monitoring and debugging

---

## **📸 Demo Includes**

* HTML form file
* Screenshot of Cloud Storage bucket showing saved user data
* Screenshot of Cloud Function logs (successful trigger + stored data output)

---

## **📂 Purpose**

This project demonstrates how to build a minimal, production-ready **serverless backend workflow**. It can be used as a foundation for more advanced applications like feedback systems, lead collection, portfolio contact forms, or event registrations.
